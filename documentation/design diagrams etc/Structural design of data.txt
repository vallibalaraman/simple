STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF DATA
Note the role of quotation marks in defining some keys as string literals (one per instance), as opposed to variables (may be many per instance).
Variable keys have no siblings in this document, and leaf node values are JavaScript primitives, and other node values are containers.
This document was not done before all coding, but it was done before the sprint that coded most of this structure.

level: object (max of 6 levels, but presently only one, called "1600")
  type: object (4 types)
    hardWord: object
      "definitions": object
        partOfSpeech: definition (string)
      "defaults": object
        partOfSpeech: suggestion (string)
      "sentenceInfo": object
        sentenceId: object (sentenceId can be inputSentenceId or outputSentenceId)
          [[textArrayIndex: object (this and contents can best be added in Analyzer if needed since a hard word may be found more than once in a sentence)]]
            "replacement": suggestion (string)
            "partOfSpeech": string
      "suggestions": object
        partOfSpeech: array
          number: object
            "suggestion": string
            "vocab": string
            "synset": number
inputSentenceId: array (was object)
  number: array (was "textArray": array)
    number: string
outputSentenceId: object/sparse Array
   number: string
