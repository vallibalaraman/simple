STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF DATA
Note the role of quotation marks in defining some keys as string literals (one per instance), as opposed to variables (may be many per instance).
Variable keys have no siblings in this document, and leaf node values are JavaScript primitives, and other node values are containers.
This document was not done before all coding, but it was done before the sprint that coded most of this structure.

"1600": object (max of 6 levels, but presently only one, called "1600")
  type: object (4 types)
    hardWord: object
      "definitions": object
        partOfSpeech: definition (string)
      "sentenceInfo": object
        sentenceId: object (sentenceId is index in sentences[])
          hardIndex: partOfSpeech (string) (was textArrayIndex = {"replacement": suggestion (string), "partOfSpeech": string)}
      "suggestions": object
        partOfSpeech: array
          number: object
            "suggestion": string
            "vocab": string
            "synset": number
"sentences": array
  number: object
    "textArray": array
      number: textFragment
    "replace": object
      index: replacement (string)     
"defaults": object
  hardWord: object
    partOfSpeech: replacement (string)
    "unknownPoS": replacement (string)
    
 OLD
inputSentenceId: array (was object)
  number: array (was "textArray": array)
    number: string
outputSentenceId: array (sparse, better than object if I need to loop in order of number, but I guess I don't)
   number: string
