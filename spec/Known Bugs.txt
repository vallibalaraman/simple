Known Bugs:
itemManager.createItem(' ') or itemManager.createItem({dataEtc: {data: ' '}}) etc. will create ids that consist only of spaces
itemManager.createItem is programmed to give up looking for unique id after about 10 trillion attempts. Is this too many or too few?
itemManager.createItem is programmed to limit localIds to 64 chars. Is this too many or too few?
itemManager does not deal with foreignIds (i.e. server ids). Can this be taken care of in dataEtc?
when item.setDataEtc() is passed an array, it accepts it, but maybe this is okay?
items have subscribers and publishers ids each stored twice, once in array and once in object to use hash instead of search. Will size matter?
The following test produces an unexpected id, which is 'faith_9_10'
  describe("when item.addPublisherId is called with an invalid id", function () {
    it("ensures item returns false", function() {
      var item = itemManager.createItem({localId: 'faith', publisherIds: ['hope', 'love']});
      var result = item.addPublisherId([]);
It doesn't seem secure: getItem and getItems?
Need a way to export core?
